    "## Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal encoding** is used when the categorical data has an inherent order or hierarchy. In this method, the categories are assigned an integer value based on their rank or order. Eg: in a survey question asking about education level, \"High School\" might be assigned a lower value than \"Bachelor's Degree\" because it is lower in the educational hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label encoding** on the other hand, assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable. This method does not consider any inherent order or hierarchy in the data. Eg: in a dataset of colors, \"Blue\" might be assigned a value of 1, \"Green\" a value of 2, and \"Red\" a value of 3."

    "## Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding** is a technique used to encode categorical variables by ordering the categories according to their impact on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The categories are ranked in order of their mean target value, and then each category is assigned a numerical value based on its rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a categorical variable called \"occupation\" with the following categories: \"doctor,\" \"lawyer,\" \"engineer,\" \"teacher,\" \"salesperson,\" and \"clerk.\" We want to predict whether a person earns more than $50,000 per year, which is our target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can group the categories of \"occupation\" by their mean target value (i.e., the proportion of people who earn more than $50,000 per year for each category) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Doctor: 0.8\n",
    "2. Lawyer: 0.7\n",
    "3. Engineer: 0.6\n",
    "4. Teacher: 0.4\n",
    "5. Salesperson: 0.3\n",
    "6. Clerk: 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can order the categories in descending order based on their mean target value:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Doctor: 1\n",
    "2. Lawyer: 2\n",
    "3. Engineer: 3\n",
    "4. Teacher: 4\n",
    "5. Salesperson: 5\n",
    "6. Clerk: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can assign these numerical values to each category in the original dataset. This will convert the categorical variable into an ordinal variable that preserves the relationship between the categories and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful when there is a strong relationship between the target variable and the categorical variable, as it can help capture this relationship in the encoded variable. This can improve the predictive power of a machine learning model by providing a more informative input variable."

    "## Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two random variables. Specifically, it measures how much two variables vary together, meaning how much the values of one variable change when the values of the other variable change. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to vary in opposite directions. A covariance of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it provides a way to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. This relationship can be used to better understand the underlying data and can help in modeling and prediction. For example, in finance, the covariance between two stocks can be used to construct a diversified portfolio that minimizes risk. In machine learning, covariance is used in dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to find the most important features or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the covariance between two variables X and Y is: cov(X, Y) = E[(X - μX) * (Y - μY)]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where E[] represents the expected value or mean, μX and μY are the means of X and Y, and * represents multiplication.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the covariance is often estimated from a sample of data using the following formula: **cov(X, Y) = Σ[(xi - μX) * (yi - μY)] / (n - 1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where Σ represents the sum, xi and yi are the individual observations of X and Y, μX and μY are the sample means of X and Y, and n is the sample size.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the magnitude of the covariance depends on the units of measurement of the two variables. Therefore, it is common to normalize the covariance by dividing it by the product of the standard deviations of X and Y. This normalized version is called the correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1 and is unitless."
